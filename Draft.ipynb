The **working environment** is friendly, with staff willing to help and guide new employees. The **pay and benefits** package is considered attractive, and **flexible work arrangements** are offered.   \\\\n  \\\\n However, there are some potential challenges, such as a **heavy workload** with expectations of overtime and weekend work.

Next, the user inquired about the current CEO of DBS Singapore. I conducted a web search and found that Tan Su Shan is the CEO and Director of DBS Group as of March 2025. Additional information from official DBS sources confirms that Tan Su Shan has over 35 years of banking experience, previously served as Deputy CEO and Group Head of Institutional Banking, and has been recognized globally for her influence in the industry. \\n\\nSubsequently, the user asked about the location of RHB Bank's headquarters. I performed a web search and found that RHB Bank's headquarters is located at Tower Two & Three, RHB Centre, Jalan Tun Razak, 50400 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The information was verified through multiple sources, including Bank Negara Malaysia and RHB Group's official regional presence pages.\\n\\nUpdated conversation summary: The user has explored various topics, including a joke, a haiku, and key leadership figures in banking.
