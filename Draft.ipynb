The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (\\u201c**CCS**\\u201d) marked its 20th anniversary today, celebrating two decades of safeguarding market competition and consumer interests. The milestone coincides with the unveiling of a refreshed corporate identity as \\\"CCS\\\", signalling its commitment to fostering well-functioning markets in an increasingly complex global landscape. The rebrand embodies the agency's confidence in new beginnings, growth, maturity, and renewed clarity of purpose whilst retaining its full legal name \\u2014 Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore.\\n\\n**Two Decades of Decisive Market Intervention**\\n\\n2. Since its establishment in 2005, CCS has evolved from a competition regulator to an active cultivator of healthy market conditions and a bold enforcer in competition and consumer protection across industries which affect Singaporeans. Since its inception, the agency has issued 23 infringement decisions and imposed financial penalties exceeding S$106 million.\\n\\n3. CCS has also successfully reviewed more than 110 merger and acquisition proposals across multiple industries, demonstrating its commitment to keeping Singapore's markets open and contestable, whilst at the same time having a clear, predictable and timely framework, enabling the timely completion of multi-billion-dollar cross-border transactions.\\n\\n**Expanding Consumer Protection Mandate**\\n\\n4. 2018 also marked a pivotal expansion when CCS assumed fair-trading functions, broadening its mission to include consumer protection. In the last year, the agency concluded 10 consumer protection cases, taking decisive action against unfair practices across sectors from beauty services and water filtration systems to digital marketplaces and food delivery services. Two significant cases underscore CCS's resolve: successfully obtaining a three-month imprisonment sentence against a managing director for contempt of court, and the first court action against a business using new business entities to evade detection when it engaged in unfair business practices.\\n\\n5. On 1 July 2025, CCS further expanded its mandate by assuming consumer product safety and legal metrology functions, bringing together oversight for consumer protection issues under one roof.\\n\\n**Strategic Government Partnership and Innovation**\\n\\n6. As the Government's advisor on competition matters, CCS has provided over 350 discrete pieces of competition advice to the Whole-of-Government whilst launching innovative programmes including the revamped Competition Impact Assessment Guidelines incorporating consumer protection guidance, and a new \\u201cMarket Studies-as-a-Service\\u201d programme offering customised market analysis to government agencies.\\n\\n**Addressing Global Economic Challenges**\\n\\n7. Speaking at the anniversary celebration, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Gan Kim Yong highlighted the critical role CCS plays in maintaining Singapore's economic strength and resilience amid growing global uncertainties.\\n\\n\\u201cBy continuously adapting its tools, strengthening its regulatory agility, and contributing to regional and international frameworks on competition law, CCS will help ensure that our markets remain fair, trusted and resilient. This will give businesses the confidence to invest and innovate, provide consumers the assurance that their interests are safeguarded, and ensure that Singapore preserves our competitiveness on the global stage.\\\" he said.\\n\\n**Strategic Regulatory Enhancements**\\n\\n8. CCS announced regulatory enhancements across two key areas today to strengthen market fairness and improve service delivery as Singapore navigates an evolving economic landscape.\\n\\ni.**Improving Regulatory Efficiency:**CCS is reducing assessment timeframes and introducing an enhanced settlement framework offering stronger early resolution incentives, reducing compliance costs whilst focusing resources on complex matters.\\n\\nii.**Enhanced TR 76 on e-commerce transactions:** Co-created through a consensus-based, multi-stakeholder approach, the enhanced TR 76 guidelines represent a significant step forward in ensuring Singapore's e-commerce market remains competitive and consumer-friendly, providing clearer guidance on accurate product information listing, addressing fake reviews, and preventing misleading user interfaces, whilst helping guide industry players on the appropriate use of automated tools and artificial intelligence.\\n\\n**Strengthening International Leadership**\\n\\n9.CCS continues to lead regionally within ASEAN and globally through its membership in the International Competition Network's (\\u201c**ICN**\\u201d) Steering Group since 2015. CCS's Chief Executive, Mr Alvin Koh has been elected as Vice-Chair of ICN for the next two years, while CCS co-chairs the Advocacy working group from 2024 to 2027.\\n\\n10. These initiatives reflect CCS\\u2019s commitment to remaining agile, pragmatic, and forward-looking as Singapore\\u2019s national body for competition and consumer protection matters.\\n\\n11. CCS\\u2019s Chairman, Mr Max Loh said, \\u201cBusinesses innovate because they must compete on merit. As a result, consumers enjoy a wider variety of choices and lower prices.

Our mission is to make markets work well to create opportunities and choices for businesses and consumers in Singapore.\\n\\nCCS administers and enforces the Competition Act 2004 and the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003, to guard against anti-competitive activities and unfair trade practices.

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (\\\\u201c**CCS**\\\\u201d) marked its 20th anniversary today, celebrating two decades of safeguarding market competition and consumer interests. The milestone coincides with the unveiling of a refreshed corporate identity as \\\\\"CCS\\\\\", signalling its commitment to fostering well-functioning markets in an increasingly complex global landscape. The rebrand embodies the agency\\'s confidence in new beginnings, growth, maturity, and renewed clarity of purpose whilst retaining its full legal name \\\\u2014 Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore.\\\\n\\\\n**Two Decades of Decisive Market Intervention**\\\\n\\\\n2. Since its establishment in 2005, CCS has evolved from a competition regulator to an active cultivator of healthy market conditions and a bold enforcer in competition and consumer protection across industries which affect Singaporeans. Since its inception, the agency has issued 23 infringement decisions and imposed financial penalties exceeding S$106 million.\\\\n\\\\n3. CCS has also successfully reviewed more than 110 merger and acquisition proposals across multiple industries, demonstrating its commitment to keeping Singapore\\'s markets open and contestable, whilst at the same time having a clear, predictable and timely framework, enabling the timely completion of multi-billion-dollar cross-border transactions.\\\\n\\\\n**Expanding Consumer Protection Mandate**\\\\n\\\\n4. 2018 also marked a pivotal expansion when CCS assumed fair-trading functions, broadening its mission to include consumer protection. In the last year, the agency concluded 10 consumer protection cases, taking decisive action against unfair practices across sectors from beauty services and water filtration systems to digital marketplaces and food delivery services. Two significant cases underscore CCS\\'s resolve: successfully obtaining a three-month imprisonment sentence against a managing director for contempt of court, and the first court action against a business using new business entities to evade detection when it engaged in unfair business practices.\\\\n\\\\n5. On 1 July 2025, CCS further expanded its mandate by assuming consumer product safety and legal metrology functions, bringing together oversight for consumer protection issues under one roof.\\\\n\\\\n**Strategic Government Partnership and Innovation**\\\\n\\\\n6. As the Government\\'s advisor on competition matters, CCS has provided over 350 discrete pieces of competition advice to the Whole-of-Government whilst launching innovative programmes including the revamped Competition Impact Assessment Guidelines incorporating consumer protection guidance, and a new \\\\u201cMarket Studies-as-a-Service\\\\u201d programme offering customised market analysis to government agencies.\\\\n\\\\n**Addressing Global Economic Challenges**\\\\n\\\\n7. Speaking at the anniversary celebration, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Gan Kim Yong highlighted the critical role CCS plays in maintaining Singapore\\'s economic strength and resilience amid growing global uncertainties.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cBy continuously adapting its tools, strengthening its regulatory agility, and contributing to regional and international frameworks on competition law, CCS will help ensure that our markets remain fair, trusted and resilient. This will give businesses the confidence to invest and innovate, provide consumers the assurance that their interests are safeguarded, and ensure that Singapore preserves our competitiveness on the global stage.\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\n**Strategic Regulatory Enhancements**\\\\n\\\\n8. CCS announced regulatory enhancements across two key areas today to strengthen market fairness and improve service delivery as Singapore navigates an evolving economic landscape.\\\\n\\\\ni.**Improving Regulatory Efficiency:**CCS is reducing assessment timeframes and introducing an enhanced settlement framework offering stronger early resolution incentives, reducing compliance costs whilst focusing resources on complex matters.\\\\n\\\\nii.**Enhanced TR 76 on e-commerce transactions:** Co-created through a consensus-based, multi-stakeholder approach, the enhanced TR 76 guidelines represent a significant step forward in ensuring Singapore\\'s e-commerce market remains competitive and consumer-friendly, providing clearer guidance on accurate product information listing, addressing fake reviews, and preventing misleading user interfaces, whilst helping guide industry players on the appropriate use of automated tools and artificial intelligence.\\\\n\\\\n**Strengthening International Leadership**\\\\n\\\\n9.CCS continues to lead regionally within ASEAN and globally through its membership in the International Competition Network\\'s (\\\\u201c**ICN**\\\\u201d) Steering Group since 2015. CCS\\'s Chief Executive, Mr Alvin Koh has been elected as Vice-Chair of ICN for the next two years, while CCS co-chairs the Advocacy working group from 2024 to 2027.\\\\n\\\\n10. These initiatives reflect CCS\\\\u2019s commitment to remaining agile, pragmatic, and forward-looking as Singapore\\\\u2019s national body for competition and consumer protection matters.\\\\n\\\\n11. CCS\\\\u2019s Chairman, Mr Max Loh said, \\\\u201cBusinesses innovate because they must compete on merit. As a result, consumers enjoy a wider variety of choices and lower prices. Singapore prospers because our economy remains dynamic, open, and fair. At our core lies a simple but powerful belief: when markets work well, everyone benefit.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**\\\\u2013 End \\\\u2013**\\\\n\\\\n**About the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore**\\\\n\\\\nThe Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (\\\\u201c**CCS**\\\\u201d) is a statutory board of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Our mission is to make markets work well to create opportunities and choices for businesses and consumers in Singapore.\\\\n\\\\nCCS administers and enforces the Competition Act 2004 and the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003, to guard against anti-competitive activities and unfair trade practices.

Blackpink, the record-shattering girl group, is now continuing its path to global dominance as they embark on another world tour. And its individual members\\\\u2014Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo and Rose\\\\u2014are also trying to blaze their own path in an industry that\\\\u2019s mostly been dominated by large talent agencies.\\\\n\\\\nThen there\\\\u2019s politics and policymaking. Asia [only has a handful of female heads of government](https://fortune.com/2025/10/04/japan-first-female-prime-minister-sanae-takaichi-iron-lady-hawk-stimulus-spending/). Among them,\\\\u00a0Singapore\\\\u2019s Josephine Teo is promoting the city-state\\\\u2019s ambition to become an \\\\u201cAI nation,\\\\u201d while Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike is positioning Japan\\\\u2019s capital as a hub for global finance and innovation at a moment when the mantle of \\\\u201cAsia\\\\u2019s financial center\\\\u201d is still up for grabs.\\\\n\\\\nProfessional sports is another area where Asian women are expanding their influence. Some of Asia\\\\u2019s most prominent, influential\\\\u2014and marketable\\\\u2014athletes are a reminder that identity and heritage can often go beyond borders. Naomi Osaka and Eileen Gu both grew up outside of Asia, but have embraced their Japanese and Chinese heritage respectively, and won new fans in their adopted countries.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s who makes it onto *Fortune\\\\u2019*s inaugural Most Influential Women Asia list (and read [our takes on each woman here](https://fortune.com/2025/10/06/introducing-fortune-first-ever-most-influential-women-asia-ranking/))\\\\n\\\\n### **Arts and Culture**\\\\n\\\\n### **Public Leadership and Policy**\\\\n\\\\n### **Sports**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a9 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
