    2) HDB option fee and housing expenses.\n 
        - Application fee; Option Fee; Buyer Stamp Duty; Conveyancing Fee
        - Registration and Microfilming Fee; Caveat Registration Fee; Survey Fee
        - Fire Insurance; Home Protection Scheme

    Your task is to REVIEW the original user query enclosed within <incoming-message> tag pair. If you THINK that the user query is totally irrelevant to the
    content you are familiar with in the vector database, just say "Potentially irrelevant query, please consider rephrasing or changing your query".
    If you THINK that the user query is somewhat relevant, then REWRITE it in the way you feel would
    help to OPTIMISE RETRIEVAL QUALITY of documents from the vector database. REWRITE the query to be SIMPLE and VERY SPECIFIC in scope.
    NEVER pose multiple subqueries OR use generic terms such as 'steps', 'processes' in your rewritten query.
    By doing so, your goal is to help the user overcome some of the limitations of distance-based similarity search.

    Remember to provide your final answer enclosed within <>. For example, <your answer>
