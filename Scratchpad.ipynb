The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“**CCCS**”) has cleared the proposed acquisition of Global Sea Containers Limited(“**Seaco**”) by Typewriter Ascend Ltd (“**TAL**”) (collectively, the “**Parties**”) (the “**Proposed Transaction**”). [1]\\n\\n2. CCCS has assessed that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, will not infringe the section 54 prohibition of the Competition Act 2004 (the “**Act**”), which prohibits mergers that may substantially lessen competition within any market in Singapore.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\n3. On 16 July 2025, CCCS commenced its review of the Parties’ application for a decision on whether the Proposed Transaction would result in a merger that may substantially lessen competition. CCCS conducted a public consultation from 16 July 2025 to 30 July 2025 and sought voluntary feedback from various stakeholders, including competitors and customers of the Parties. Respondents generally did not raise concerns.\\n\\n**CCCS’s Assessment**\\n\\n4. The Parties overlap in the supply (including sale and lease) of intermodal containers, including dry box containers, refrigerated shipping containers, and dry freight special containers, in Singapore.\\n\\n5. Following CCCS’s assessment of the Parties’ submissions and third party feedback, CCCS has concluded that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in Singapore in relation to the supply of intermodal containers. The market would remain competitive in view of the following:\\n\\na. The Parties are not each other’s closest competitor and there remain many other competitors post-Transaction;\\n\\nb. There are many alternative suppliers of intermodal containers, and customers can switch between these suppliers easily;\\n\\nc. Low barriers to entry and expansion in the supply of intermodal containers to customers;\\n\\nd. The merged entity may be able to better compete with larger suppliers of intermodal containers; and\\n\\ne. Customers are likely to have bargaining power.\\n\\n6. Further information on the notification and CCCS’s Grounds of Decision will be made available in due course on [CCCS’s Public Register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/cases-and-commitments/public-register).\\n\\n- End -\\n\\n**About The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore**\\n\\nThe Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“**CCCS**”) is a statutory board of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Our mission is to make markets work well to create opportunities and choices for businesses and consumers in Singapore.\\n\\nCCCS administers and enforces the Competition Act 2004 and the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003, to guard against anti-competitive activities and unfair trade practices.

Proposed Acquisition of Global Sea Containers Limited by Typewriter Ascend Ltd\\n\\nNotification | Cleared\\n\\nProposed Acquisition of Global Sea Containers Limited by Typewriter Ascend Ltd\\n==============================================================================\\n\\n16 July 2025\\n\\nTable caption\\n\\nReference:CCCS 400-140-2025-004\\nNotifying Party:Typewriter Ascend Ltd and Global Sea Containers Limited\\nNotifying Date:15 July 2025\\nSummary of Transaction:**a.the names of the merger parties;**\\n\\nThe merger parties in this transaction are Typewriter Ascend Ltd (“**TAL**”); and Global Sea Containers Limited (“**Seaco**”), (collectively, the “**Parties**”).\\n\\n**b.a description of the transaction;**\\n\\nThe notification relates to the proposed acquisition by TAL of the entire issued and outstanding shares of Seaco from Bohai Leasing Co., Ltd (“**Bohai**”) (the “**Proposed Transaction**”).\\n\\n**c.a description of the business activities of the merger parties worldwide and in Singapore;**\\n\\n**TAL**\\n\\nTAL is a special purpose vehicle indirectly solely controlled by investment funds managed and/or controlled by Stonepeak Partners LP (“**Stonepeak**”). Stonepeak is a global alternative investment firm specialising in infrastructure and real assets, headquartered in New York. Stonepeak operates in the market for the sale and lease of intermodal containers through Textainer Group Holdings Limited (“**Textainer**”), a Bermuda-based entity that is indirectly and solely controlled by funds and investment vehicles advised and/or managed by affiliates of Stonepeak. Textainer offers these services globally, including to customers in Singapore.\\n\\n**Seaco**\\n\\nSeaco is an international container leasing and sales company specialising in intermodal containers for a variety of industries. Seaco offers these services globally, including to customers in Singapore.\\n\\n**d.a description of the overlapping goods or services, including brand names;**\\n\\nTextainer and Seaco overlap in the sale and lease of intermodal containers, which includes dry boxes, reefers and specials.\\n\\n**e.a description of substitute goods or services from demand-side and supply-side considerations;**\\n\\nIn relation to the sale and lease of intermodal containers, similar services offered by the competitors of the Parties would be considered close substitutes from both a demand-side and supply-side perspective. The Parties also face equally strong competitive constraints from container sales by manufacturers as customers can elect to purchase containers directly from a manufacturer.\\n\\n**f.the applicant’s views on:**\\n\\n**i.definition of the relevant market(s);**\\n\\nThe Parties consider that the relevant market for the purposes of this notification is the overall supply of intermodal containers globally.\\n\\n**ii.the way in which competition functions in this market;**\\n\\nIn the market for the supply of intermodal containers, container lessors and manufacturers compete on the basis of price and container availability. In addition to constraints posed by strong competitors, the Parties also face equally strong competitive constraints from container sales by manufacturers. Customers can elect to either purchase containers directly from a manufacturer or lease from a lessor. Often, price is the primary consideration in making this choice.\\n\\n**iii.barriers to entry and countervailing buyer power; and**\\n\\nNo significant barriers to entry or expansion\\n\\nThe Parties submit that there are no significant barriers to entry in the market for the supply of intermodal containers in Singapore. Entry into the container sale and leasing space is not heavily constrained or subject to significant structural barriers, aside from the need for some upfront capital. Further, intermodal containers are readily available from a wide range of established manufacturers and new entrants can procure equipment on commercially standard terms.\\n\\nStrong countervailing buyer power\\n\\nThe Parties submit that customers of the Parties have strong countervailing buyer power, given that the customer base of both Parties is highly sophisticated and procures containers through competitive bidding processes.\\n\\n**iv.the competitive effects of the merger (non-coordinated, coordinated and/or vertical effects, as relevant).**\\n\\nCoordinated effects\\n\\nThe Proposed Transaction will not give rise to any coordinated effects for the supply of intermodal containers in view of the following: (a) large number of competitors; (b) buyers have significant buying power and typically procure containers through competitive bidding processes; and (c) the low barriers to entry.\\n\\nNon-coordinated effects\\n\\nThe Proposed Transaction would not give rise to any non-coordinated effects for the supply of intermodal containers, due to the following:\\n\\n(a) there are numerous strong competitors;\\n\\n(b) the bidding nature of the industry ensures competition;\\n\\n(c) ease of switching; and\\n\\n(d) the absence of material barriers to entry or expansion.\\n\\nVertical and conglomerate effects\\n\\nThe Proposed Transaction would not give rise to any vertical effects, as there is no existing vertical relationship between Textainer and Seaco.\\n\\nThe Parties submit that no competition concerns arising from conglomerate effects would arise from the Proposed Transaction. The Parties do not gain any capabilities to supply containers arising from the Proposed Transaction which they do not respectively have prior to the Proposed Transaction.\\nDecision:19 August 2025\\n\\nFollowing its assessment of the Parties’ submissions and third party feedback, CCCS has concluded that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in Singapore in relation to the supply of intermodal containers.\\n\\n[Read the media release.](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/newsroom/announcements-and-media-releases/cccs-clears-proposed-acquisition-of-global-sea-containers-limited-by-typewriter-ascend-ltd/)\\n\\nRead the [Grounds of Decision](https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/45/f1318a7a-c61d-4f8c-a69f-a5cf7c6a1210/Grounds%20of%20Decision%20for%20Proposed%20Acquisition%20of%20Seaco%20by%20TAL.pdf).\\n\\n[Back to top](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/public-register/mergers-and-acquisitions/proposed-acquisition-of-global-sea-containers-limited-by-typewriter-ascend-ltd/#)\\n\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Anti-competitive practices](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/)[Consumer protection](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/consumer-protection/)[Case register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/)[Media and events](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/)[Resources](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/resources/)\\n\\n### Reach us\\n\\n[](http://www.facebook.com/cccs.sg)[](https://www.instagram.com/cccs_sg/)[](http://www.youtube.com/user/theccs05)[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/cccs-sg)\\n\\n[Contact](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/get-in-touch/general-feedback/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://form.gov.sg/6837b4cfa0e95b6f507441b3)\\n\\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 5 September 2025\\n\\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\\n\\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\\n\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Anti-competitive practices](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/)[Consumer protection](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/consumer-protection/)[Case register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/)[Media and events](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/)[Resources](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/resources/)\\n\\n### Reach us\\n\\n[](http://www.facebook.com/cccs.sg)[](https://www.instagram.com/cccs_sg/)[](http://www.youtube.com/user/theccs05)[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/cccs-sg)\\n\\n[Contact](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/get-in-touch/general-feedback/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://form.gov.sg/6837b4cfa0e95b6f507441b3)\\n\\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 5 September 2025\\n\\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\\n\\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\\n\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/newsroom/announcements-and-media-releases/cccs-consults-on-the-proposed-acquisition-of-global-sea-containers-limited-by-typewriter-ascend-ltd/\", \"title\": \"CCCS Consults on the Proposed Acquisition of Global Sea ...\", \"content\": \"CCCS Consults on the Proposed Acquisition of Global Sea Containers Limited by Typewriter Ascend Ltd. 16 July 2025.

Redacted confidential information in the text of the published version of the Decision is denoted by [\\uf022]. Page 2 of 5 I. Introduction 1. On 15 July 2025, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“CCCS”) accepted a joint application by Global Sea Containers Limited (“Seaco”) and Typewriter Ascend Ltd (“TAL”) (collectively, the “Parties”), through Allen & Gledhill LLP, for a decision pursuant to s 57 of the Competition Act 2004 (the “Act”) as to whether the proposed acquisition of shares of Seaco by TAL (the “Proposed Transaction”) will infringe s 54 of the Act, if carried into effect. 2. In reviewing the Proposed Transaction, CCCS conducted a public consultation from 16 July 2025 to 30 July 2025 and sought voluntary feedback from various stakeholders. 16 third parties, including a member of public, competitors, and customers, provided substantive feedback. The majority of third parties did not raise competition concerns.1 Some customers2 were concerned about a reduction in the number of major suppliers post-Transaction. However, these customers indicated that they (a) do not view the Parties as the “next best alternative” to each other, (b) consider a wide range of suppliers through competitive tender process, (c) would be able to switch to other intermodal container suppliers post-Transaction, and (d) would consider purchasing intermodal containers from manufacturers directly based on cost, availability, and other considerations. 3. At the end of the consultation process and after evaluating the available information, CCCS has concluded that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, would not infringe s 54 of the Act. II. The Parties 4. The acquirer, TAL, is a special purpose vehicle indirectly solely controlled by investment funds managed and/or controlled by Stonepeak Partners LP (“Stonepeak”).3 Stonepeak operates in the market for the sale and lease of intermodal containers through Textainer Group Holdings Limited (“Textainer”). 4 Textainer offers these services globally, including to customers in Singapore.5 5. The target, Seaco, is an international container leasing and sales company which is active globally and in Singapore, specializing in intermodal containers for a variety of industries.6 1 [\\uf022] 2 [\\uf022] 3 Paragraph 7.1 of Form M1. 4 Paragraph 7.1 of Form M1. 5 Paragraph 10.10 of Form M1. 6 Paragraphs 10.9 and 10.11 of Form M1. Page 3 of 5 III. Competition issues 6. The Parties submitted that they overlap in the market for the leasing and sale of intermodal containers used for global containerised cargo transport, including dry boxes, refrigerated shipping containers, and dry freight special containers.7 7. Given the nature of the overlap between the Parties, CCCS’s assessment of the Proposed Transaction focused on the potential non-coordinated 8 and coordinated effects 9 in Singapore arising from the horizontal overlaps between the Parties. No vertical or conglomerate effects in Singapore were identified as arising from the Proposed Transaction. IV. Relevant markets 8. Based on information provided by the Parties and feedback from third parties, CCCS proceeded with the assessment by reference to the market for the global-to-global supply (sale and lease) of intermodal containers.10 V. Competition assessment 9. Based on the information received, CCCS assessed that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to give rise to non-coordinated effects in Singapore, for the following reasons: a. The Parties are not the next best alternative to each other. While all third parties considered the Parties to be direct competitors, they generally do not consider the Parties to be the next best alternative to each other.11 b. Presence of many competitors which customers can switch to with ease. According to third party feedback, ease of switching is high. Customers have been and would be able to lease intermodal containers from a wide range of suppliers, as well as purchase intermodal containers directly from manufacturers.12 7 Paragraphs 15.1 and 19.1 of Form M1. 8 Non-coordinated effects arise when there is a loss of competition between the merging parties and the merged entity finds it profitable to raise prices and/or reduce output, or quality or innovation. Paragraph 4.8 of CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers. 9 Coordinated effects arise if the merger raises the possibility of firms in the market coordinating their behaviour to raise prices, reduce quality, or output or innovation. Paragraph 4.8 of CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers. 10 Paragraphs 19.1 and 20.4 of Form M1. 11 [\\uf022] 12 [\\uf022] Page 4 of 5 c. Low barriers to entry and expansion. Suppliers of intermodal containers noted that they do not face significant barriers to entry and expansion in the supply of intermodal containers to customers globally and in Singapore.13 d. The merged entity may be able to better compete with larger suppliers. Based on information provided by the Parties, the combined market share (based on total installed base14 and purchase volume) of the Parties post-Transaction would be on par with the largest supplier, and the combined market share (based on volumes of new intermodal containers either leased or purchased) would be on par with the two second largest suppliers. e. Customers are likely to have countervailing buyer power. Feedback received from several customers indicated instances of successful bargaining for better prices and inventory at demand locations.15 10. Based on the information received, CCCS assessed that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to give rise to coordinated effects in Singapore, for the following reasons: a. Presence of many competitors. While the number of intermodal container lessors would decrease, there are many competitors who would be able to supply intermodal containers to customers globally post-Transaction; and b. Low degree of market transparency. Customers typically lease and procure intermodal containers through individual request for quotation and competitive bidding/tender. 16 Customers also tend to have different selection criteria and bargain17 for better terms with suppliers through individual negotiations. VI. Conclusion 11. For the reasons above and based on the information available, CCCS has assessed that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, would not lead to a substantial lessening of competition in Singapore and consequently, would not infringe s 54 of the Act. 13 [\\uf022] 14 Installed base refers to the total volume of containers under lease. 15 [\\uf022] 16 [\\uf022] 17 [\\uf022] Page 5 of 5 12. In accordance with s 57(7) of the Act, the decision will be valid for a period of one year from the date of CCCS’s decision.

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“**CCCS**”) has cleared the proposed acquisition of Global Sea Containers Limited(“**Seaco**”) by Typewriter Ascend Ltd (“**TAL**”) (collectively, the “**Parties**”) (the “**Proposed Transaction**”). [1]\\n\\n2. CCCS has assessed that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, will not infringe the section 54 prohibition of the Competition Act 2004 (the “**Act**”), which prohibits mergers that may substantially lessen competition within any market in Singapore.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\n3. On 16 July 2025, CCCS commenced its review of the Parties’ application for a decision on whether the Proposed Transaction would result in a merger that may substantially lessen competition. CCCS conducted a public consultation from 16 July 2025 to 30 July 2025 and sought voluntary feedback from various stakeholders, including competitors and customers of the Parties. Respondents generally did not raise concerns.\\n\\n**CCCS’s Assessment**\\n\\n4. The Parties overlap in the supply (including sale and lease) of intermodal containers, including dry box containers, refrigerated shipping containers, and dry freight special containers, in Singapore.\\n\\n5. Following CCCS’s assessment of the Parties’ submissions and third party feedback, CCCS has concluded that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in Singapore in relation to the supply of intermodal containers. The market would remain competitive in view of the following:\\n\\na. The Parties are not each other’s closest competitor and there remain many other competitors post-Transaction;\\n\\nb. There are many alternative suppliers of intermodal containers, and customers can switch between these suppliers easily;\\n\\nc. Low barriers to entry and expansion in the supply of intermodal containers to customers;\\n\\nd. The merged entity may be able to better compete with larger suppliers of intermodal containers; and\\n\\ne. Customers are likely to have bargaining power.\\n\\n6. Further information on the notification and CCCS’s Grounds of Decision will be made available in due course on [CCCS’s Public Register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/cases-and-commitments/public-register).\\n\\n- End -\\n\\n**About The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore**\\n\\nThe Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“**CCCS**”) is a statutory board of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Our mission is to make markets work well to create opportunities and choices for businesses and consumers in Singapore.\\n\\nCCCS administers and enforces the Competition Act 2004 and the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003, to guard against anti-competitive activities and unfair trade practices. Additionally, CCCS ensures that businesses observe fair trade measurement practices by administering the Weights and Measures Act 1975, and ensures the supply of safe consumer goods by enforcing and implementing the Consumer Protection (Trade Descriptions and Safety Requirements) Act 1975 and its associated Regulations.\\n\\nFor more information, please visit [www.cccs.gov.sg](http://www.cccs.gov.sg/).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[1] The Proposed Transaction will be executed through TAL’s purchase of Seaco’s shares.\\n\\n[Back to top](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/newsroom/announcements-and-media-releases/cccs-clears-proposed-acquisition-of-global-sea-containers-limited-by-typewriter-ascend-ltd/#)\\n\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Anti-competitive practices](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/)[Consumer protection](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/consumer-protection/)[Case register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/)[Media and events](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/)[Resources](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/resources/)\\n\\n### Reach us\\n\\n[](http://www.facebook.com/cccs.sg)[](https://www.instagram.com/cccs_sg/)[](http://www.youtube.com/user/theccs05)[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/cccs-sg)\\n\\n[Contact](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/get-in-touch/general-feedback/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://form.gov.sg/6837b4cfa0e95b6f507441b3)\\n\\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 5 September 2025\\n\\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\\n\\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\\n\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Anti-competitive practices](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/)[Consumer protection](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/consumer-protection/)[Case register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/)[Media and events](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/)[Resources](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/resources/)\\n\\n### Reach us\\n\\n[](http://www.facebook.com/cccs.sg)[](https://www.instagram.com/cccs_sg/)[](http://www.youtube.com/user/theccs05)[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/cccs-sg)\\n\\n[Contact](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/get-in-touch/general-feedback/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://form.gov.sg/6837b4cfa0e95b6f507441b3)\\n\\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 5 September 2025\\n\\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\\n\\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\\n'}, {'url': 'https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/singapores-cccs-clears-proposed-typewriter-ascend-seaco-deal', 'title': \"Singapore's CCCS Clears Proposed Typewriter Ascend-Seaco Deal\", 'content': 'Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world \\n### For Customers\\n\\n       Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login\\n       Software Updates\\n       Manage Products and Account Information\\n\\n### Support\\n\\nAmericas+1 212 318 2000\\n\\nEMEA+44 20 7330 7500\\n\\nAsia Pacific+65 6212 1000\\n\\n   ### Company [...] Singapore’s CCCS Clears Proposed Typewriter Ascend-Seaco Deal\\n\\nAug. 19, 2025, 8:24 AM UTC\\n\\nImage 13: Rieka Rahadiana\\n\\n Rieka Rahadiana \\n\\nBloomberg News\\n\\nImage 14: Email Rieka Rahadiana\\n\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore clears Typewriter Ascend Ltd’s proposed acquisition of Global Sea Containers Ltd (Seaco).

Redacted confidential information in the text of the published version of the Decision is denoted by [\\uf022]. Page 2 of 5 I. Introduction 1. On 15 July 2025, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“CCCS”) accepted a joint application by Global Sea Containers Limited (“Seaco”) and Typewriter Ascend Ltd (“TAL”) (collectively, the “Parties”), through Allen & Gledhill LLP, for a decision pursuant to s 57 of the Competition Act 2004 (the “Act”) as to whether the proposed acquisition of shares of Seaco by TAL (the “Proposed Transaction”) will infringe s 54 of the Act, if carried into effect. 2. In reviewing the Proposed Transaction, CCCS conducted a public consultation from 16 July 2025 to 30 July 2025 and sought voluntary feedback from various stakeholders. 16 third parties, including a member of public, competitors, and customers, provided substantive feedback. The majority of third parties did not raise competition concerns.1 Some customers2 were concerned about a reduction in the number of major suppliers post-Transaction. However, these customers indicated that they (a) do not view the Parties as the “next best alternative” to each other, (b) consider a wide range of suppliers through competitive tender process, (c) would be able to switch to other intermodal container suppliers post-Transaction, and (d) would consider purchasing intermodal containers from manufacturers directly based on cost, availability, and other considerations. 3. At the end of the consultation process and after evaluating the available information, CCCS has concluded that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, would not infringe s 54 of the Act. II. The Parties 4. The acquirer, TAL, is a special purpose vehicle indirectly solely controlled by investment funds managed and/or controlled by Stonepeak Partners LP (“Stonepeak”).3 Stonepeak operates in the market for the sale and lease of intermodal containers through Textainer Group Holdings Limited (“Textainer”). 4 Textainer offers these services globally, including to customers in Singapore.5 5. The target, Seaco, is an international container leasing and sales company which is active globally and in Singapore, specializing in intermodal containers for a variety of industries.6 1 [\\uf022] 2 [\\uf022] 3 Paragraph 7.1 of Form M1. 4 Paragraph 7.1 of Form M1. 5 Paragraph 10.10 of Form M1. 6 Paragraphs 10.9 and 10.11 of Form M1. Page 3 of 5 III. Competition issues 6. The Parties submitted that they overlap in the market for the leasing and sale of intermodal containers used for global containerised cargo transport, including dry boxes, refrigerated shipping containers, and dry freight special containers.7 7. Given the nature of the overlap between the Parties, CCCS’s assessment of the Proposed Transaction focused on the potential non-coordinated 8 and coordinated effects 9 in Singapore arising from the horizontal overlaps between the Parties. No vertical or conglomerate effects in Singapore were identified as arising from the Proposed Transaction. IV. Relevant markets 8. Based on information provided by the Parties and feedback from third parties, CCCS proceeded with the assessment by reference to the market for the global-to-global supply (sale and lease) of intermodal containers.10 V. Competition assessment 9. Based on the information received, CCCS assessed that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to give rise to non-coordinated effects in Singapore, for the following reasons: a. The Parties are not the next best alternative to each other. While all third parties considered the Parties to be direct competitors, they generally do not consider the Parties to be the next best alternative to each other.11 b. Presence of many competitors which customers can switch to with ease. According to third party feedback, ease of switching is high. Customers have been and would be able to lease intermodal containers from a wide range of suppliers, as well as purchase intermodal containers directly from manufacturers.12 7 Paragraphs 15.1 and 19.1 of Form M1. 8 Non-coordinated effects arise when there is a loss of competition between the merging parties and the merged entity finds it profitable to raise prices and/or reduce output, or quality or innovation. Paragraph 4.8 of CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers. 9 Coordinated effects arise if the merger raises the possibility of firms in the market coordinating their behaviour to raise prices, reduce quality, or output or innovation. Paragraph 4.8 of CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers. 10 Paragraphs 19.1 and 20.4 of Form M1. 11 [\\uf022] 12 [\\uf022] Page 4 of 5 c. Low barriers to entry and expansion. Suppliers of intermodal containers noted that they do not face significant barriers to entry and expansion in the supply of intermodal containers to customers globally and in Singapore.13 d. The merged entity may be able to better compete with larger suppliers. Based on information provided by the Parties, the combined market share (based on total installed base14 and purchase volume) of the Parties post-Transaction would be on par with the largest supplier, and the combined market share (based on volumes of new intermodal containers either leased or purchased) would be on par with the two second largest suppliers. e. Customers are likely to have countervailing buyer power. Feedback received from several customers indicated instances of successful bargaining for better prices and inventory at demand locations.15 10. Based on the information received, CCCS assessed that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to give rise to coordinated effects in Singapore, for the following reasons: a. Presence of many competitors. While the number of intermodal container lessors would decrease, there are many competitors who would be able to supply intermodal containers to customers globally post-Transaction; and b. Low degree of market transparency. Customers typically lease and procure intermodal containers through individual request for quotation and competitive bidding/tender. 16 Customers also tend to have different selection criteria and bargain17 for better terms with suppliers through individual negotiations. VI. Conclusion 11. For the reasons above and based on the information available, CCCS has assessed that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, would not lead to a substantial lessening of competition in Singapore and consequently, would not infringe s 54 of the Act. 13 [\\uf022] 14 Installed base refers to the total volume of containers under lease. 15 [\\uf022] 16 [\\uf022] 17 [\\uf022] Page 5 of 5 12. In accordance with s 57(7) of the Act, the decision will be valid for a period of one year from the date of CCCS’s decision.

Stonepeak is a global alternative investment firm specialising in infrastructure and real assets, headquartered in New York. Stonepeak operates in the market for the sale and lease of intermodal containers through Textainer Group Holdings Limited (“**Textainer**”), a Bermuda-based entity that is indirectly and solely controlled by funds and investment vehicles advised and/or managed by affiliates of Stonepeak. Textainer offers these services globally, including to customers in Singapore.\\n\\n**Seaco**\\n\\nSeaco is an international container leasing and sales company specialising in intermodal containers for a variety of industries. Seaco offers these services globally, including to customers in Singapore.\\n\\n**d.a description of the overlapping goods or services, including brand names;**\\n\\nTextainer and Seaco overlap in the sale and lease of intermodal containers, which includes dry boxes, reefers and specials.\\n\\n**e.a description of substitute goods or services from demand-side and supply-side considerations;**\\n\\nIn relation to the sale and lease of intermodal containers, similar services offered by the competitors of the Parties would be considered close substitutes from both a demand-side and supply-side perspective. The Parties also face equally strong competitive constraints from container sales by manufacturers as customers can elect to purchase containers directly from a manufacturer.\\n\\n**f.the applicant’s views on:**\\n\\n**i.definition of the relevant market(s);**\\n\\nThe Parties consider that the relevant market for the purposes of this notification is the overall supply of intermodal containers globally.\\n\\n**ii.the way in which competition functions in this market;**\\n\\nIn the market for the supply of intermodal containers, container lessors and manufacturers compete on the basis of price and container availability. In addition to constraints posed by strong competitors, the Parties also face equally strong competitive constraints from container sales by manufacturers. Customers can elect to either purchase containers directly from a manufacturer or lease from a lessor. Often, price is the primary consideration in making this choice.\\n\\n**iii.barriers to entry and countervailing buyer power; and**\\n\\nNo significant barriers to entry or expansion\\n\\nThe Parties submit that there are no significant barriers to entry in the market for the supply of intermodal containers in Singapore. Entry into the container sale and leasing space is not heavily constrained or subject to significant structural barriers, aside from the need for some upfront capital. Further, intermodal containers are readily available from a wide range of established manufacturers and new entrants can procure equipment on commercially standard terms.\\n\\nStrong countervailing buyer power\\n\\nThe Parties submit that customers of the Parties have strong countervailing buyer power, given that the customer base of both Parties is highly sophisticated and procures containers through competitive bidding processes.\\n\\n**iv.the competitive effects of the merger (non-coordinated, coordinated and/or vertical effects, as relevant).**\\n\\nCoordinated effects\\n\\nThe Proposed Transaction will not give rise to any coordinated effects for the supply of intermodal containers in view of the following: (a) large number of competitors; (b) buyers have significant buying power and typically procure containers through competitive bidding processes; and (c) the low barriers to entry.\\n\\nNon-coordinated effects\\n\\nThe Proposed Transaction would not give rise to any non-coordinated effects for the supply of intermodal containers, due to the following:\\n\\n(a) there are numerous strong competitors;\\n\\n(b) the bidding nature of the industry ensures competition;\\n\\n(c) ease of switching; and\\n\\n(d) the absence of material barriers to entry or expansion.\\n\\nVertical and conglomerate effects\\n\\nThe Proposed Transaction would not give rise to any vertical effects, as there is no existing vertical relationship between Textainer and Seaco.\\n\\nThe Parties submit that no competition concerns arising from conglomerate effects would arise from the Proposed Transaction. The Parties do not gain any capabilities to supply containers arising from the Proposed Transaction which they do not respectively have prior to the Proposed Transaction.\\nDecision:19 August 2025\\n\\nFollowing its assessment of the Parties’ submissions and third party feedback, CCCS has concluded that the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in Singapore in relation to the supply of intermodal containers.\\n\\n[Read the media release.](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/newsroom/announcements-and-media-releases/cccs-clears-proposed-acquisition-of-global-sea-containers-limited-by-typewriter-ascend-ltd/)\\n\\nRead the [Grounds of Decision](https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/45/f1318a7a-c61d-4f8c-a69f-a5cf7c6a1210/Grounds%20of%20Decision%20for%20Proposed%20Acquisition%20of%20Seaco%20by%20TAL.pdf).\\n\\n[Back to top](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/public-register/mergers-and-acquisitions/proposed-acquisition-of-global-sea-containers-limited-by-typewriter-ascend-ltd/#)\\n\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Anti-competitive practices](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/)[Consumer protection](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/consumer-protection/)[Case register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/)[Media and events](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/)[Resources](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/resources/)\\n\\n### Reach us\\n\\n[](http://www.facebook.com/cccs.sg)[](https://www.instagram.com/cccs_sg/)[](http://www.youtube.com/user/theccs05)[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/cccs-sg)\\n\\n[Contact](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/get-in-touch/general-feedback/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://form.gov.sg/6837b4cfa0e95b6f507441b3)\\n\\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 5 September 2025\\n\\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\\n\\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\\n\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Anti-competitive practices](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/)[Consumer protection](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/consumer-protection/)[Case register](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/case-register/)[Media and events](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/)[Resources](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/resources/)\\n\\n### Reach us\\n\\n[](http://www.facebook.com/cccs.sg)[](https://www.instagram.com/cccs_sg/)[](http://www.youtube.com/user/theccs05)[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/cccs-sg)\\n\\n[Contact](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/get-in-touch/general-feedback/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://form.gov.sg/6837b4cfa0e95b6f507441b3)\\n\\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 5 September 2025\\n\\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\\n\\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\\n'}, {'url': 'https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/competition-watchdog-seeks-public-feedback-proposed-takeover-seaco-parent-stonepeak-backed-entity', 'title': 'Competition watchdog seeks public feedback on proposed takeover ...', 'content': \"In the application, the companies said that they overlap in the sale and leasing of intermodal containers – including dry box containers, refrigerated shipping containers and dry freight special containers.

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) is seeking public feedback on the proposed acquisition of Global Sea Containersby an entity controlled by US investment firm Stonepeak.\\n\\nOn Wednesday (Jul 16), the competition watchdog said that it accepted a joint application from Global Sea Containers and special purpose vehicle Typewriter Ascend for a decision on whether the proposed transaction would be anti-competitive.\\n\\nIn the application, the companies said that they overlap in the sale and leasing of intermodal containers – including dry box containers, refrigerated shipping containers and dry freight special containers. However, they added that there are no supply relationships between them.\\n\\nThis comes as Global Sea Containers’ wholly owned subsidiary, Seaco, and the company behind Typewriter Ascend, Stonepeak, both operate intermodal sales and leasing activities.\\n\\nSeaco is an international container leasing and sales company that specialises in intermodal containers for various industries.\\n\\nIt is owned by Bohai Leasing, a Shenzhen-listed transportation and infrastructure asset leasing company and an arm of failed Chinese conglomerate HNA Group.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\n![Lambency Detailing posted unauthorised reviews using names of its customers and photos of their vehicles. ](https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/58b1882dcb34f1dcbe7aad83e252355d46857624852787a0288ad861954a8f1a?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp)\\n\\n### [CCCS takes action against car groomer Lambency Detailing for posting fake AI reviews](/singapore/cccs-takes-action-against-car-groomer-lambency-detailing-posting-fake-ai-reviews?ref=article-see-also \"CCCS takes action against car groomer Lambency Detailing for posting fake AI reviews\")\\n\\nStonepeak is a New York-headquartered global alternative investment company specialising in infrastructure and real assets that\\xa0controls Typewriter Ascend. It operates in the intermodal container sales and leasing market via Textainer Group, which offers these services to customers globally.\\n\\nCCCS is inviting public feedback from 5 pm on Wednesday until Jul 30, 5pm.
